### Hi there, I am Sweta Sengupta.I am a Lambda School Data Science graduate and I am passionate about using technology to both make things more efficient and to find and make conclusions that would otherwise be much harder to find. ðŸ‘‹


Some things to know about me:

ðŸ›° Languages include: Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS and Visual Basic (specifically for Excel).
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: a Pygame  to refresh my OOP Python skills.
ðŸ¥§ Fun fact: Not only am I into code and all it can do, but I am also a clinical psychologist with a passion for food.
