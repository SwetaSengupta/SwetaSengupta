Hi there, I am Sweta Sengupta. I am passionate about using technology to both make things more efficient and to find and make conclusions that would otherwise be much harder to find. 👋


Some things to know about me:

🛰 Languages include: Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Visual Basic (specifically for Excel).

🔭 I’m currently working on: a pygame  to refresh my OOP Python skills.

🥧 Fun fact: Not only am I into code and all it can do, but I am also a clinical psychologist with a passion for food.
